The FDA says it sent a warning letter to HelloCig in October, citing a number of concerns about illegal marketing claims. HelloCig was misbranding and selling its products in the United States as an "FDA approved product with FDA," in violation of federal rules.
"FDA recently warned HelloCig of these issues and contacted the company several times to recommend they recall these products due to the risks to consumers. However, HelloCig has not responded to the agency's recommendation," the agency said in its warning.
Bottles of E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid were sold with an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets, while advertisements on Twitter and Tumbir showed "a partially undressed couple embracing," the FDA says. The caption states, "WOOOOW, Have you tried our E-Cialis? It is amazing LOL."
